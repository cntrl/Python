Python
======
Well these are my attempts to do some minor web crawling / scraping aiming to improve my Python skills.  The websites used are just examples, I do not intend to actually use the information, they just seem to be used as some handy examples.  
## Requirement
* Python 3  
* Beautifulsoup, Requests libraries


The crawlers are oriented mainly on the source code described by thenewboston in one of his youtube tutorials, so feel free 
to fork, edit, do whatever you like with it...
